# Interact

A lightweight JavaScript framework that provides a React-like API for creating virtual DOM elements.

## What I'm Working On

Interact is my attempt to build a modern alternative to React. The goal is to create a framework that maintains the familiar component-based development experience that developers love about React, while exploring different approaches to virtual DOM implementation and state management.

This project represents my journey in understanding how frontend frameworks work under the hood and experimenting with new ways to solve common UI development challenges.
